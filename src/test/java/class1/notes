get() vs navigate()
both serves the same purpose

get()--cant go back or forward in history
navigate()-- you can go back and forward and refresh

get()--it waits for the whole page to load
nag()--it doesn't wait for the whole page to load

close()--close the current tab
quiz()--quit the whole browser

fullscreen() vs maximize()
-- maximize() will maximize the browser and you will still be able to see url, tabs, bookmarks
   fullscreen() will maximize the whole web application

tag name= is only 1 word

WebElements: whatever you see on a website--button , image, etc

DOM---Document Object Model
**********************************************************


    What is a WebElement?
    anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
    e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

    HTML?
    HyperText Markup Language

    What is DOM?
    DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
    internal view of the webpage.
    Also called as Developer's tools, or Dev tools
    Document --> can be stored any document as pdf, excel
    Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
    Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

    Locator
    is an address or a position of an webelement on the web page
    is used to locate or identify webelements on the webpage

    8 Locators:
    - ID
    - Name
    - Tagname
    - xpath
    - linktext
    - partialLinkText
    - CSS Selector
    - ClassName


    Why do we need many locators?
    -- some locators might have duplicate values in other nodes
    -- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements



    <button>click me</button>
    a text is always located betweeen >< of the tag (i.e opening and closing of the tag
    the above tag has text

    <a href="g"></a>
    the above tag has no text
