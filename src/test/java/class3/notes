Last 2 locators
1.Absolute Xpath:
    reason why they done use it that much
    1. the path may change if any change is made in the document
    2. its too long

    ex.
    <html>
        <body>
            <input>--input is a dead end
            <p>hello</p>
        </body>
    </html>

/html/body/p/  ---this is how you would write it above the code

2. Relative Xpath
Syntax:
    //tagname[@attribute='value']
    hey het me as tagname "which has attribute" "whose vaule is"

    //link[@rel='stylesheet']
    hey get me the tagname "link" which has an attribute"


you can find an element using

attribute: most common
    we can use any attribute, provided that it doesnt have numbers, spaces, and is unique enough

    //tagname[@attribute='value']

text: most common
    the element must have text
    //tagname[text()='value']

contains method:
    we can use partial vaule of attribute or text. This is helpful when we have no other opinion
    and all the available attributes have either digits or spaces don't put numbers

    attribute //tagname[contains(@name,'value')]

    text//tagname[contains(text(),'value')]

startswith:
has to begin with that value or

    attribute //tagname[starts-with(@attribute,'value')]

    test//tagname[starts-with(text(),'value')]

indexing:
    should be the last resort when you have no other option to select the element uniquely

    (xpath)[index]//tagname[@attribute='value'])[index]

use of and operator: common
    we can use and operator to specify more then one condition for our element, to locate it uniquley

    //tagname[@attribute='value' and @attribute='value']


****************************************************************************************

last locator CSS
