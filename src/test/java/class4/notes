shouldnt use class if it has space
dont put numbers becuase the numbers might change late and it will become error

when we're using CONTAINS, we do not have to use full attribute, as long as those were digits,
and they may change in future we omitted using them

************************************************
CSS does not allow you to access an element using its text content.

Instead of writing this use shortcuts
attribute:
     tagname[attribute='value']

*Shortcuts*

id:
    tagname#value ---shortcut
    # is only for id

class:
    tagname.value
    if there is a space in the class, you replace that space with a dot

contains:
    tagname[attribute*='value']
    when we're using CONTAINS, we do not have to use full attribute, as long as those were digits, and they may change in future we omitted using them

start-with:
    tagname[attribute^='value']
    Selects elements whose attribute value starts with the specified value.

Ends-with:
    tagname[attribute$='value']
    Purpose: Selects elements whose attribute value ends with the specified value.

Tips:

When an attribute has digits or spaces, you can use the advanced attribute selectors to avoid the locator getting redundant.
