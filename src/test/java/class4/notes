shouldnt use class if it has space
dont put numbers becuase the numbers might change late and it will become error

when we're using CONTAINS, we do not have to use full attribute, as long as those were digits,
and they may change in future we omitted using them

web element commands
    sendkeys

Instend of wiriting this use shortcuts
attribute:
     tagname[attribute='value']

*Shortcuts*

id:
    tagname#value ---shortcut
    # is only for id

class:
    tagname.value
    if there is a space in the class, you replace that space with a dot

contains:
    tagname[attribute*='value']
    when we're using CONTAINS, we do not have to use full attribute, as long as those were digits, and they may change in future we omitted using them
