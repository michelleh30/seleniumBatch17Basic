class for dealing with frames:
 //instance
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

        driver.get("http://");
//        maximize the window
        driver.manage().window().maximize();
this is dynamic
the url always changes

CommonMethods

===========================================================================
Implicit wait

its global wait:
        once declared is stated its automatically implemented to all the webelements that need to be found


    its going to wait
        until the element is found

    if element not found
        it will return you with an exception

    if element is found it will immediately on to the next piece of code

syntax:
    driver.mange().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSec(70));

=======================================================================================
Implict wait:
    waits for the element to be found in DOM
    then implicit wait will work because it is waiting for input field to appear/load in to the DOM

Implicit wait is going to wait until web element is found NOT LOADED, JUST FOUND.
Implicit wait is going to wait until web element is found (all the elements of my class)

Explicit wait:
    when there is a Conditional wait
    for a certain condition to be fulfilled specified by user

martha notes
IMPLICIT WAIT:

implicit wait is going to wait until web element is found NOT LOADED, JUST FOUND in DOM.
implict wait is hopfully when the code is not in the DOM

If it's not found it will
    return you an exception.

If found - will immediately move to the next piece of code.
    when the code is not there

SYNTAX:
  driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration of seconds(20)); 20 sec here is a max time of limit
  (Duration of seconds(20)--timeout, max time of limit that it will wait
  20sec is good time

It's a global wait:
    ones declared in start it's automatically implemented to all the elements that are needed
    to be found
        ex 20sec

===============================================================================================
EXPLICIT WAIT:
     Explicit wait waits for a certain condition to be fulfilled (e.g. is enabled) regarding the element,
     the condition is specified by user.
     Element is already there
     when the code is DOM

rough syntax:
wait.until.webElment to be displayed ()



real syntax for Explicit wait:


2. Conditon      :    wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elmenttobeVisible(By.xpath("")));

Not global wait
