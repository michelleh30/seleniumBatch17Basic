right click is also know contect click

====================================================================
Action class allows us to do operations such as:

Hover over
Drag and drop
right click
double click
simple click
etc

use built when calling multiple methods in Actions class

The build() method in Selenium is used to create a composite action
that contains all the actions gathered which are ready to be performed.
The perform() method is used to execute the chain of actions which are built using the
Action build method.
===================================================================

JSExecutor:
jsExecutor is used to execute java script code.

In javascript you:
-declare instance of Js executor ---  JavascriptException js=(JavascriptException) driver;
-.executeScript(code to execute);


if u want to scroll:
1) JavascriptException js=(JavascriptException) driver;
2) js.executeScript("window.scrollBy(0,-500)");
================================================================

SCREEN SHOT:
1) Declare the instance of take sc
                    TakesScreenshot ts=(TakesScreenshot) driver;
2) Take the screen shot
                    ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.file)

   file format- simple file, pic you save
   byte format - pic in representation of numbers

3. Save the screenshot on pc
    FileUtil.copyFile(filename,pth where you want to save)
==================================================================
Keys:
    send keys to a webElement
  Helps us to use mouse and keyboard actions

  1. locate the webElement
  2. webElement.sendkeys(Keys.Enter/Tab/ecs)--any keyboard key you want to use

use case:
    you want to login and need to enter the info and press enter
    you should send keys

    if a user story says that user hits enter key, you can
======================================================================
Action Class
    1. declare the instance of action clas
    2. action.(what ever action you want to do).perform();
        action.click(WebElement).perform();
        action.moveToElement(WebElement).perform();

        When ever you chain different methods use .build at the end to build the
        chain of actions and perform to execute them
        action.clickAndHold.moveToElement().Releases().build().perform();

usecase:
    drag and drop, right click(context click),scroll,hover
================================================================
js Executor:
    allows us to execute jva script
    when Selenium built-in methods are not sufficient for interacting with web elements

1. declare the instance

2. js.executescript(script,element)

From where you will get the script?--Google

What is the most common jsExecutescript functionality used-- click().

because sometimes the regular click operation doesn't work and at that point js click will always work

use case:
    scroll, click highlight the element boundary
==============================================
take screenshot:
1. declare the instance--   TakesScreenshot ts=(TakesScreenshot)driver;

2. take the screenshot--    File screenShot= ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);

3. to save the screenshot - FileUtils.copyFile(screenShot, new File(path));





Dependency needed to save the screenshot --> commons-io



system.getPropery(usr.dir)
