Why do we need waits?
    to sync the scribe to the website(to overcome synchronization issues)
    wait for the element to be  loaded
    Wait for the element to fulfill the conditions( wait for the element to be clickable)

Using thread.sleep-disadvantages
    1. its still going to wait if the elememnt has been found for the mentioned duration,
    which makes our code slower
================================================================================================
Implicits wait:
    going to wait until "THE ELEMENT IS FOUND"
        1. if the element is found, it will end the wait time and move on
        2.if the element is not found (in duration of time out) it will return us with excetion

        syntax:
            driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSecond(20))
            timeout--Max wait time

======================================================================================================
Explicit wait:
    When the element is not in dom and certain condition should fulfill
        ex. waiting for a element to have a text, clickable etc
            1. as soon as the condition is fulled it moves on to the NEXT line of code
            2. if the condition isn't fulfilled (in the duration of time out) it will give an exception

            syntax:
                WebDriverWait wait=new WebDriverWait(driver. Duration.ofSeconds(20));
                wait.until(ExpetedCondition."THE CONDITION FOR WHICH YOU WANT TO WAIT"(The webElement);
                ex.
                    wait.until(ExpectedCondition.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath(//button[text()='Enabled']")));"

=============================================================================================

*Biggest different bettween the two*

Implicits wait: is golbal wait

Explicit wait: local, has to be declared for every individual element if needed
==============================================================================================

impl is not in dom
expl is in dom, but we have a condition, that's the reason why we use the wait,
cause the code will find it very quick, but because of condition it would not work:)
=======================================================================================================
When you get no such element exception:
    your code cant find the element
    *you have the wrong xpath/locator*
====================================================================
Tables:
    <table name="company">

    <thead>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>

tr[" +(i+1)+ "]"))
    we are adding a varible inside a string
    (i+1) this convert to a number
